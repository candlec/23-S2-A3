    This solution makes use of a binary search tree select_islands, with the nodes ordered
    via InOrder depending on the islandâ€™s ratio of marines to money, to help determine
    which island is the least profitable. It then traverses through the bst comparing the
    number of island marines to the remaining available crew appending both the given
    island and sent crew amount to a list which is returned. For example, using the
    islands: (name='A', money=400, marines=100), (name='B', money=300, marines=150),
    (name='C', money=100, marines=5), (name='D', money=350, marines=90),
    (name='E', money=300, marines=100), the ratios (keys) would respectably be
    0.25, 0.5, 0.05, 0.257, 0.333. Using InOrder the islands would be ordered as
    C, A, D, E, B and therefore the crew would be allocated in such a way.
    The solution has a complexity of O(n), BSTInOrderOperator has a complexity of O(n) where
    n is the size of the bst, select_islands additionally has two separate O(n) functions,
    however none of these are nested so it would have a complexity of O(n + n + n) which
    would just be O(n).
